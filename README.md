# Metro-Price-to-Rent

**1.  What is the question you hope to answer?

What type of property should a real estate investor buy in Broward County Florida to be used as an airbnb?

**2.  What data are you planning to use to answer that question?

Redfin Sales Data - Broward County Florida (2012 to present)
Airbnb Rental Data - Broward County Florida (2016 to present)
 
**3.  What do you know about the data you're using so far?

The Redfin Sales Data is limited to the medial sales price by type of property in each month.  Property types include single family, condos, townhomes, and 2-4 unit multifamily.  I haven't explored the Airbnb data, but it looks robust.

**4.  Why did you choose this topic?

I'm interested in owning rental properties in Florida.  The Broward County data was available from Airbnb.
